                      After the American software company, Recast Software had acquired Centero Oy, my job continued working with Carillon and related products.
                      I have been working on revamping the project infrastructure and bringing new architectural changes to life.
                      Currently, my task is to build a new software replacement for Centero's Carillon.

                      My first tasks included developing new functionality for Centero's customer portal.
                      After that, I started to expand Centero's windows user management product, Carillon.
                      My job was to add new functionalities and make existing ones work with Azure Active Directory.

                      I served my mandatory military service at HÃ¤meenlinna's Armoured Brigade.
                      My main task was to create a new Attack Simulator and construct a VR simulator for a physical Anti-Air-Gun.
                      We built the simulators using Unreal Engine 4.

                      My task at Movya was to create a control panel application.
                      The application's tasks were downloading, updating, and deleting virtual reality software for Valmet Oyj.
                      I built the application using Unity 3D because of its UI capabilities.
